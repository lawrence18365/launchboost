# IndieSaasDeals: "Deal of the Week" Strategy

## The Problem with Current Approach
- Trying to compete with AppSumo (impossible)
- Empty marketplace looks abandoned
- No recurring engagement

## New Strategy: Weekly Newsletter + Archive Site

### Week 1: Launch "Indie Deal Weekly"
1. **Pick ONE amazing deal per week**
2. **Write a founder story** about the maker
3. **Include discount + time limit** (creates urgency)
4. **Email to growing list** + post on website

### Week 2-4: Content Machine
**Monday**: Research/reach out to 5 SaaS founders
**Tuesday**: Interview selected founder
**Wednesday**: Write deal article + founder story
**Thursday**: Schedule newsletter for Friday
**Friday**: Send newsletter + social promotion

### Email Template for Founders:
```
Subject: Feature your SaaS in "Indie Deal Weekly" (100 customers guaranteed)

Hi [Name],

I run IndieSaasDeals.com - we feature one indie SaaS tool per week to our community of startup founders.

Would you be interested in offering an exclusive 40-50% discount to our audience? Here's what we provide:

✅ Featured newsletter spot (goes to 500+ indie hackers)
✅ Founder interview + story on our blog
✅ Social media promotion across channels
✅ Guaranteed minimum 100 click-throughs to your site

Recent features: [examples]

Interested? We're booking 2 weeks out.

Best,
[Your name]
IndieSaasDeals.com
```

### Content Calendar:
**Week 1**: BacklinkDog (you already have this deal)
**Week 2**: SocialKit (you have this)
**Week 3**: Link4Dev (you have this)
**Week 4**: CustoQ (you have this)

This gives you a month of content while you recruit new deals.

## Why This Works:
1. **Scarcity**: One deal = people pay attention
2. **Story**: Founder interviews = shareable content
3. **Community**: Weekly email = recurring engagement
4. **Growth**: Founders will promote their feature
5. **SEO**: Weekly articles = fresh content for Google

## Success Metrics:
- Week 1: 50 email subscribers
- Week 2: 100 email subscribers  
- Week 3: 200 email subscribers
- Week 4: 500 email subscribers

## Social Strategy:
**Twitter**: "This week's indie deal: [Tool] - 50% off for indie hackers. Here's why founder [Name] built it... [thread]"

**Reddit**: Post founder interview in r/entrepreneur with title "I built [Tool] to solve [Problem] - AMA + 50% off for r/entrepreneur"

**Indie Hackers**: Weekly "Indie Deal Spotlight" posts with founder story

This strategy turns you from "empty marketplace" into "trusted curator" overnight.
