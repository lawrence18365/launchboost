  $$The Indie SaaS Launch Playbook: A Founder's Guide to Getting Your First 100 Customers$$::text,
  $$Stop chasing vanity metrics. This is our founder-first framework for launching your SaaS, finding your first real users, and building a business that lasts.$$::text,
  $$<h2>Stop Chasing Vanity Metrics. Start Building a Business.</h2><p>Launching a SaaS can feel like shouting into the void. You're told to grind on social media, chase upvotes, and celebrate follower counts. But likes don't pay server bills. Real, paying customers do.</p><p>We built IndieSaasDeals on a simple premise: <strong>real customers over clout</strong>. This blog is an extension of that philosophy. We won't give you empty "growth hacks." We'll share actionable, honest playbooks for building a sustainable business. This is your home for practical advice, not vanity-metric hype.</p><h2>The 3-Step Indie Launch Framework</h2><p>Getting your first 100 customers is the hardest part. It’s a game of grit, not growth hacks. Here’s a simple framework that works.</p><h3>Step 1: Find Your "First 10" in Niche Communities</h3><p>Your first users won't find you on Google. You have to find them. Go where they already are and become a valuable member of the community before you ever pitch your product.</p><ul><li><strong>Engage honestly:</strong> Participate in discussions on platforms like Indie Hackers, specific subreddits (e.g., r/saas), or private Slack/Discord groups. Answer questions, offer help, and build relationships.</li><li><strong>Listen for pain points:</strong> Identify problems people are struggling with that your tool can solve. This is your entry point.</li><li><strong>Offer exclusive access:</strong> Once you've built trust, privately offer a free account or a heavy discount to a few members in exchange for honest feedback.</li></ul><h3>Step 2: Build a "Feedback Flywheel"</h3><p>Your first 10 users are not just customers; they are your most critical product development partners. Their feedback is gold. Create a tight loop to capture and act on it.</p><ul><li><strong>Create a dedicated channel:</strong> Use a private Discord channel, a Slack group, or even a simple email list to make it incredibly easy for them to report bugs and suggest features.</li><li><strong>Act on feedback visibly:</strong> When you ship a fix or a feature they asked for, announce it to the group. This shows you're listening and builds incredible loyalty.</li><li><strong>Ask "why":</strong> Don't just take feature requests at face value. Dig deeper to understand the underlying problem they are trying to solve.</li></ul><h3>Step 3: Use a Value-First Launch to Get to 100</h3><p>Once your product is polished and validated by your first 10 users, it's time to scale up. Instead of a broad, generic launch, use a value-first platform to attract your next 90 users. Offering a compelling, limited-time deal is the single best way to get early adopters to take a chance on a new product.</p><p>This is why we built IndieSaasDeals. It’s a curated space where you can offer a genuine discount directly to a community of users actively looking for new tools. It cuts through the noise and focuses on the only thing that matters: a value exchange between you and a real customer.</p><h2>What to Expect From This Blog</h2><p>This post is just the start. Moving forward, you can expect:</p><ul><li><strong>Actionable Launch Playbooks:</strong> Deep dives into topics like pricing, positioning, and customer onboarding.</li><li><strong>Honest Growth Stories:</strong> Interviews with successful indie founders on how they survived the early days.</li><li><strong>Community-Driven Insights:</strong> Analysis of trends and opportunities we see from the deals submitted to our platform.</li></ul><p>Welcome to the IndieSaasDeals blog. Let's build real businesses, together.</p>$$::text,

  $$The Founder's Guide to Measuring What Matters: 5 Metrics to Track Instead of Vanity$$::text,
  $$Stop obsessing over likes, followers, and upvotes. Here are 5 actionable metrics that signal a healthy, growing SaaS business and how to track them.$$::text,
  $$<h2>The Vanity Metric Trap</h2><p>Every founder knows the feeling. You launch on Product Hunt or Twitter, the upvotes pour in, your site traffic spikes, and the dopamine hits hard. You feel like you've made it. But a week later, the traffic is gone, and you have exactly zero new paying customers. </p><p>This is the vanity metric trap. We chase numbers that feel good but have little correlation to the health of our business. Page views, social media likes, and follower counts are easy to measure but often impossible to act on. They don't tell you if your product is valuable or if your business is sustainable.</p><h2>5 Actionable Metrics for a Healthy SaaS</h2><p>To build a real business, you need to track real metrics. These are the numbers that give you a true signal of your product's health and your financial viability. Here are five to start with.</p><h3>1. Activation Rate</h3><p><strong>What it is:</strong> The percentage of new users who complete a key "aha!" moment action within your app (e.g., creating their first project, inviting a teammate).</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It tells you if users are successfully discovering the core value of your product. A low activation rate is a sign of poor onboarding or a confusing UI.</p><p><strong>How to track it:</strong> <code>(Users who complete key action) / (Total new signups)</code></p><h3>2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</h3><p><strong>What it is:</strong> The total cost of sales and marketing to acquire a single new paying customer.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It determines the profitability of your growth. If your CAC is higher than what a customer will pay you over their lifetime, your business model is broken.</p><p><strong>How to track it:</strong> <code>(Total marketing & sales spend in a period) / (Number of new customers in that period)</code></p><h3>3. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</h3><p><strong>What it is:</strong> The predictable revenue your business earns every month from all active subscriptions.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MRR is the lifeblood of a SaaS business. It's the single most important indicator of growth and financial health.</p><p><strong>How to track it:</strong> Most payment providers like Stripe offer a dashboard that calculates this for you automatically.</p><h3>4. Churn Rate</h3><p><strong>What it is:</strong> The percentage of customers who cancel their subscription in a given period.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Churn is the silent killer of SaaS businesses. A high churn rate (often called a "leaky bucket") makes growth nearly impossible, no matter how many new customers you acquire.</p><p><strong>How to track it:</strong> <code>(Customers who canceled in period) / (Customers at start of period)</code></p><h3>5. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)</h3><p><strong>What it is:</strong> The total revenue you can expect to earn from a single customer before they churn.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> LTV is the other side of the CAC coin. A healthy SaaS business needs an LTV that is significantly higher than its CAC (a common rule of thumb is LTV > 3x CAC).</p><p><strong>How to track it (simplified):</strong> <code>(Average Revenue Per User) / (Churn Rate)</code></p><h2>How This Philosophy Shapes IndieSaasDeals</h2><p>We're obsessed with these actionable metrics because they're what our founders care about. A deal on IndieSaasDeals isn't designed to get you a spike in traffic; it's designed to get you activated, paying customers with a high potential LTV. We focus on connecting you with real users who will provide valuable feedback and help you build a sustainable business.</p><p>Stop chasing vanity. Start measuring what matters.</p>$$::text,
