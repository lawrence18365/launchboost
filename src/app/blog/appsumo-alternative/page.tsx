            Looking for an AppSumo alternative that actually cares about indie hackers? 
            Here's why IndieSaasDeals is becoming the go-to platform for startup founders 
            and builders who want real value, not just marketing hype.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-12 mb-6">Why Look for AppSumo Alternatives?</h2>
          <p className="text-black/80 mb-4">
            Don't get us wrong - AppSumo has been great for the deal space. But as indie hackers, 
            we started noticing some patterns:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-black/80 mb-8">
            <li><strong>Too mainstream</strong> - By the time deals hit AppSumo, everyone already knows about them</li>
            <li><strong>Limited indie focus</strong> - Most deals are from established companies, not scrappy startups</li>
            <li><strong>Overwhelming choice</strong> - Hundreds of deals make it hard to find gems</li>
            <li><strong>Generic targeting</strong> - Not built specifically for developers and startup founders</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-12 mb-6">Why We Started IndieSaasDeals</h2>
          <p className="text-black/80 mb-4">
            As indie hackers ourselves, we were frustrated with the existing options. Here's what drove us to build something better:
          </p>
          
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-black pl-6 text-black/80 italic mb-8">
            "We kept seeing the same pattern: great tools with amazing founders, but no good way for them to 
            reach indie hackers directly. AppSumo was great, but it felt like going to Walmart when we wanted 
            to shop at the local farmers market."
          </blockquote>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-12 mb-6">How to Choose the Right Deal Platform</h2>
          <p className="text-black/80 mb-4">
            When evaluating deal platforms, consider these factors:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-black/80 mb-8">
            <li><strong>Audience fit</strong> - Does the platform understand your specific needs?</li>
            <li><strong>Deal quality</strong> - Are deals curated or just quantity-focused?</li>
            <li><strong>Community</strong> - Can you connect with like-minded users?</li>
            <li><strong>Founder access</strong> - Can you reach out to makers directly?</li>
            <li><strong>Refund policy</strong> - What happens if the tool doesn't work out?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mt-8 mb-4">Is IndieSaasDeals really free?</h3>
          <p className="text-black/80 mb-6">
            Yes! Browsing deals and joining our community is completely free. We make money through 
            partnerships with SaaS founders, not by charging users.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mt-8 mb-4">How do you vet deals?</h3>
          <p className="text-black/80 mb-6">
            Every deal goes through our indie hacker review process. We test the tools ourselves, 
            talk to the founders, and make sure they're legitimate before featuring them.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mt-8 mb-4">Can I still use AppSumo?</h3>
          <p className="text-black/80 mb-6">
            Absolutely! Many of our users complement their AppSumo finds with our more targeted indie deals. 
            Think of us as the boutique shop next to the department store.
