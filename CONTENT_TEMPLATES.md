Title: Just launched IndieSaasDeals - feedback on my AppSumo alternative?

Hey entrepreneurs! 👋

I just soft-launched IndieSaasDeals.com - a deals platform specifically for indie hackers and small SaaS companies.

**The problem**: AppSumo focuses on big enterprise tools. Indie hackers need deals on tools built BY indies, FOR indies.

**What we do differently**:
✅ Only indie/small SaaS companies  
✅ Better commission rates for founders
✅ Community-driven (not corporate)
✅ Focus on <$100 tools (not $500+ enterprise stuff)

**Current status**: 4 users, 30+ deals, just getting started

**Question**: What would make you choose us over AppSumo? What deals would you want to see?

Any feedback welcome! 🙏

## **TWITTER/X THREADS (If you get someone to post)**

### **Thread 1: Origin Story**
```
🧵 Why I built IndieSaasDeals (thread)

1/ I'm an indie hacker building SaaS tools. Every time I needed software, I'd check AppSumo...

2/ But 90% of their deals are for enterprise tools I don't need. Where are the deals on indie tools made by people like me?

3/ So I built IndieSaasDeals - exclusively for indie hackers and small SaaS companies.

4/ The difference:
→ Tools under $100 (not $500+)  
→ Made by indies, for indies
→ Better founder revenue splits
→ Community-driven curation

5/ Week 1 results:
- 4 → [X] users
- 30+ exclusive deals
- [X] claimed deals
- Learning every day

6/ Goal: Become the go-to deals platform for the indie community.

- Curated deals on indie SaaS tools
- Made by indies, for indies  
- Better revenue splits for founders
- Community-driven (not corporate sales-driven)

- [X] users
- 30+ deals
- Built with Next.js, Supabase
- Just getting started

1. Would you use something like this?
2. What deals would you want to see?
3. Any obvious improvements?
