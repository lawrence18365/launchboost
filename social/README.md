Social Share Card (X/Twitter)

What this is
- A ready-to-edit vector template at 1200×675 (16:9) for X.
- Includes: headline, gratitude line, creator handle pills, CTA button, and a logo placeholder.

How to edit
- Open `social/x-share-card-1200x675.svg` in Figma, Sketch, Illustrator, or any SVG editor.
- Replace the `YOUR LOGO` box with your logo (drag your SVG/PNG in and size it to fit).
- Edit text:
  - Headline: keep to 2 lines for best legibility.
  - Gratitude line: optional emoji is fine (❤️ ✅ 🎉).
  - Creator pills: change `@creator1` … `@creator5` to real handles; 3–6 is ideal.
  - CTA: set `[YOUR_URL]` to your live directory or deals page.
  - Watermark: set `[Brand]` to your brand name.
- Export as PNG at 1x: 1200×675. Keep under 5MB.

Recommended X settings
- Size: 1200×675 (16:9). This displays cleanly on mobile and web.
- Safe zone: keep key text inside ~60px margins; center-left is safest.
- Alt text: add a concise description (see examples below).
- Posting time: align with your audience’s top time block.
- Pin: pin the post for launch week.

Alt text examples
- “Share image announcing our Creator Directory deals. Headline: ‘Deals are live in our Creator Directory’. Includes thanks to creators and a button ‘Explore deals → [YOUR_URL]’. Blue gradient background.”
- “Thank you to our creators. Announcement card for our live deals.”

Tips
- Contrast: headline should pass accessibility contrast over the background (white on deep blue works well).
- Don’t overstuff handles: 3–6 max; add the rest in the thread copy.
- If using a photo or collage, keep a 60–80% dark overlay behind text.

Need variants?
- Square (1200×1200) and vertical (1080×1350) versions are easy to derive from this; ask and we’ll add them.
